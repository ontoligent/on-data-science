<h2>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>In 2008, the year of Google’s tenth anniversary, the primary meaning of
the term “data science” (and the related term “data scientist”) changed.
From at least the early 1990s up to this time the term referred to an
established if obscure field dedicated to the processing and management
of scientific data. This field was represented by journals such as
CODATA’s <em>Data Science Journal</em> (founded in 2002) and addressed in
high-level policy reports from the NSF in the US and JISC in the UK
(Simberloff et al. 2005; Swan and Brown 2008). After 2008, resulting
from the usage of “data scientist” by dominant internet companies like
LinkedIn and Facebook, and promoted by influential bloggers like Nathan
Yau of <em>FlowingData</em>, the term shifted meaning to a wildly popular
activity within the data-driven corporation (Davenport and Patil 2012;
Hammerbacher 2009; Yau 2009b). The newer usage referred to an advanced
form of business intelligence, broadly defined, an eclectic mixture of
statistics, data mining, artificial intelligence, computer science, and
a host of recently developed data processing technologies designed to
store and process so-called big data—data generated by social media,
scientific instruments, transactional machinery, embedded sensors, and a
variety of other sources.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id1">1</a></p>
<p>Earlier, in the 1990s and early 2000s, the term was appropriated by a
handful of academic statisticians in Japan and the U.S. seeking to
expand and rebrand their field in response to the rapid growth and
overshadowing effects of computational statistics and data mining
(Ohsumi 1994; Wu 1997; Hayashi 1998; Cleveland 2001). However, this
usage never caught on.<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id5" id="id2">2</a></p>
<p>Since 2009, the growth of the term’s new usage and its cluster of
associated activities has been exponential. This growth has been
associated with a high demand for data scientists, a story that
continues to be covered by the news media. The response by institutions
of higher education to train data scientists to meet industry demand has
been rapid and pronounced. Since the shift in meaning, hundreds of
master’s degree programs in data science and closely related fields have
been established in the United States, both residential and online. More
recently, a handful of doctoral programs and schools of data science
have emerged, along with undergraduate offerings to meet increasing
student demand.</p>
<p>One effect of these developments has been to stimulate a preferential
attachment process within the network of disciplines that constitute the
academy: as a field representing the “sexiest job of the 21^st^
century,” attracting students, gifts, and internal resources, many
adjacent disciplines—from systems engineering and computer science to
statistics and a variety of quantitative and computational
sciences—have sought to associate themselves with the field. Indeed,
because data science has had no history in the academy, these contiguous
fields have provided the courses and faculty out of which the majority
of data science programs have been built. The result is that data
science has become a complex and internally competitive patchwork of
industrial and academic interests and perspectives, reflecting the
broader engagement of society with data and its analysis beyond the
concept of data science inherited from industry.</p>
<p>From this confluence of sources a variety of definitions of data science
have emerged. One common view within the academy is that data science is
a buzzword that just means statistics (or data analysis) rebranded in
the era of widespread computational technology. For others, the field
represents a new paradigm of science based on data abundance and <em>in
silico</em> experimentation. Some recall the older meaning, as the science
of processing and managing data to support scientific research. Outside
of academia, definitions may range, as mentioned, from a form of
business intelligence for the data-driven firm to the application of
machine learning and artificial intelligence to big data to solve real
world problems. To complicate matters further, the job descriptions of
data scientists overlap significantly with those of other roles, aside
from statistician and data analyst, ranging from business analyst to
machine learning engineer. And then there are fields like critical data
studies which bring their own understandings of data science in their
efforts to describe its social consequences and ethical obligations.</p>
<p>This variety is not necessarily a bad thing—it reflects the vibrant
fertility in the field that has contributed to its success. But when it
comes to building academic programs to meet the great demand for data
scientists, clear definitions matter. The categories, values, and
relationships they make explicit determine everything from the design of
curricula to the selection of faculty to the allocation of resources for
research. Academic programs have an obligation to arrive at a coherent
and compelling understanding of the field that will situate it among its
fellow disciplines on campus and remain relevant to the extra-academic
organizations where data scientists work. Such an understanding should
be developed from a clear understanding of the origin of data science
and why it has emerged as such a powerfully attractive rubric under
which people and resources are being marshalled.</p>
<p>So, how do we define the field so that we preserve its richness and
utility in a dynamic world while having a clear idea of its central
concerns and ideas? To answer this, we need to do more than produce a
list of all the things that data scientists do in the hopes that some
order might emerge from it. Nor are high-level constructs like
simplified Venn diagrams helpful here. In both cases, important details
and questions of meaning and priority are left to interpretation. What
we need is an understanding of why it is that such a diverse collection
of definitions would appear together in the first place. What principle
or theme, if any, brings them together?</p>

<h2>Making Sense of the Field<a class="headerlink" href="#making-sense-of-the-field" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>Ever since Nathan Yau corrected Hal Varian’s usage of “statistician” to
“data scientist” in reference to Varian’s famous quip about the former
being the “sexy job in the next ten years,” there has been no shortage
of attempts to make sense of the new field (McKinsey &amp; Company 2009; Yau
2009b).<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id6" id="id3">3</a> These generally come from either industry or academia. Among
the former are early responses from the blogosphere (Yau 2009b; 2009c;
2009a; Conway 2010; Mason and Wiggins 2010) followed by those of
industry thought leaders, such as O’Reilly (Loukides 2011), McKinsey
(Manyika et al. 2011), Harvard Business Review (Davenport and Patil
2012), Gartner (Laney and Kart 2012), and Booz Allen Hamilton (Herman et
al. 2013). Among the academic responses are those from statisticians,
the most popular being Donoho’s trenchant “50 Years of Data Science”
(Donoho 2017 [2015]).</p>
<p>For the most part, the responses from industry are descriptive and
approving while the academic ones are critical and prescriptive. Those
in industry have sought to make sense of data science as a new field to
those wishing to hire data scientists, emphasizing the unique mixture of
roles it involves, from data wrangling and exploration to software
engineering and the visual communication of results. In contrast,
academic statisticians have reacted with surprise and concern at the
glaring disconnect between their field and data science (Davidian 2013;
Rodriguez 2012; Rodriguez, Davidian, and Schenker 2013) and have
exhorted their colleagues to take ownership of the new field (Yu 2014).
Indeed, Donoho’s essay is a manifesto for doing so. He charts out the
territory of “Greater Data Science” (GDS)—a play on Chambers’ earlier
plea for a “greater statistics” that would be “based on an inclusive
concept of learning from data”—and places statistics at its center
(Chambers 1993: 1). In addition, he locates GDS in a genealogy that
begins with data analysis—a practice envisioned in the 1960s by his
mentor at Princeton, the legendary mathematician John Tukey, who serves
as the founding ancestor in this legitimation narrative. GDS is thus
defined as “a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning,
which adds some technology for ‘scaling up’ to ‘big data’” (Donoho 2017
[2015]: 745).</p>
<p>Naturally, for the purposes of academic program building the academic
contributions have been more influential. Donoho’s essay in particular
is often cited as authoritative (e.g. Cao 2017). It provides a
compelling narrative for the origin of data science (as we know it
today) and a comprehensive taxonomy of activities that might constitute
the field. It is tempting to accept this work as a foundation for
building out academic programs.</p>
<p>However, Donoho’s framework has been criticized for downplaying the
contribution of computational technology to data science. In the
response section of Donoho’s essay, Chris Wiggins, Chief Data Scientist
of the <em>New York Times</em> and a professor at Columbia, senses this and
asserts that data science is a form of engineering that will be defined
by its practitioners, not by academics trying to turn it into a (pure)
science. In his response, Sean Owen, then Director of Data Science at
Cloudera, argues that Donoho’s history excludes the significant
contributions of data engineering (Donoho 2017: 764). Owen’s criticism
is corroborated by the fact that Donoho’s history also elides the
contributions of data collection and earlier iterations of the field of
data science, especially as it has been practiced in the U.K. Elsewhere,
Bryan and Wickham point out that, like many statisticians, Donoho
mistakenly relegates computational work to superficial status while also
missing “the full process of analysis” in which statistics “is but one
small part” (Bryan and Wickham 2017). In his defense, Donoho
acknowledges his bias, but justifies it by noting that although
technological know-how is important, technologies are transitory and
prone to rapid obsolescence, and therefore “the academic community can
best focus on teaching broad principles—‘science’ rather than
‘engineering’” (Donoho 2017: 765). <em>Scientia longa, brevis ars.</em></p>
<p>Donoho’s marginalization of computational technology in his definition
of data science is consistent with a larger conflict between what
Breiman famously called “two cultures” in the field of statistics,
adapting the expression C.P. Snow used to characterize the split between
the sciences and the humanities (Breiman 2001; Snow 2013 [1959]). In
brief, one culture seeks to represent causality—the black box of
nature that generates the empirical data with which statistics
begins—by means of probabilistic or stochastic data models. The
parameters, random variables, and relationships that compose these
models are imagined to correspond to things in the world, at least in
principle. Data are used to estimate the parameters of these models.
This is the “data modeling culture,” associated with traditional
statistics and data analysis. Breiman guessed this culture comprised 98%
of all statisticians. The other culture bypasses attempts to directly
model the contents of the black box and instead focuses on accounting
for the data by means of goal-oriented algorithms, regardless of the
correspondence of these to the world. This is the “algorithmic modeling
culture,” associated with computer science, machine learning, and data
mining. Breiman described the growth of this culture as “rapid”
(beginning circa 1985) and characterized its results as “startling” and
suggested that statisticians ought to incorporate these methods into
their field (Breiman 2001: 200). As is evident from the essay’s tepid
comments and from Donohoe’s account of its weak reception by academic
statisticians, Breiman’s advice went unheeded.</p>
<p>At the heart of this conflict is the division between data analysis,
championed by Donoho, and data mining (sometimes called “knowledge
discovery in databases”), a field that emerged in the 1980s and ’90s
with the rise of available computational technology and the growth of
commodity databases, later spurred by the Web and social media. With
these resources in place—effectively forming a new infrastructure for
knowledge work—it became possible for the computationally-minded to
pursue a purely data-centric approach to statistical problems that in
many respects violates the principles and sensibilities of traditional
statistics. It is no coincidence that Breiman’s essay appeared at about
the time some academic statisticians sought to rebrand their field as
data science in an attempt to integrate the gains of computational
technology while purging it of the methodological sins of data mining.</p>
<p>Contrary to Donoho’s narrative, data mining is as much of an antecedent
to today’s form of data science as data analysis, if not more so. A
direct connection exists between the data mining practices developed and
codified in the 1990s and what Hammerbacher would later call data
science, even if he may not have been aware of the connection. The
general goal in both cases was to retrieve information from databases
that had grown to the point of exceeding their ability to be queried for
the work of business intelligence. Concretely, Hammerbacher’s work at
Facebook continued the kind of work pioneered by Amit Patel a few years
earlier at Google, who applied data mining methods to the logs the
search giant had been accumulating and revealed their predictive power
(Levy and Ganser 2012: 44–46). In both cases, the data were not
acquired for the purpose of supporting predictive or inferential
analyses, yet the data mining approach found enough value in them to
build companies that would not only become hugely profitable but, in the
case of Google, a model for science itself.</p>
<p>Regarding the connection between science and data mining that Google
shocked the world into recognizing, consider the impact data mining has
had on how the scientific method has been reimagined in the era of
pervasive computing. Gray’s framing of e-science as a fourth paradigm is
essentially data mining and computational thinking applied explicitly
and broadly to science, both in terms of specific methods and general
spirit (Gray 2007; Hey, Tansley, and Tolle 2009). The fourth paradigm
argues for the centrality of database theory and practice to the
scientific method, to bring analysis closer to where increasingly large
and complex sets of data physically live, as well for the application of
the core data mining methods of pattern and rule discovery beyond
traditional hypothesis testing. Essential to this view is that database
technologies are not merely add-ons to a process that can be imagined
without them; the scientist now inhabits an infrastructure that
constitutes her experience. Science now trades in forms of knowledge
that do not exist without the computational technologies that generate
them. What Gray says about astronomy is a parable for all science:</p>
<p>People now do not actually look through telescopes. Instead, they are
“looking” through large-scale, complex instruments which relay data to
datacenters, and only then do they look at the information on their
computers (Hey, Tansley, and Tolle 2009: xix).</p>
<p>In other words, databases and the workflows built around them constitute
the symbolic form of science (Manovich 1999); they are the medium of
knowledge, not its vehicle. And this is the perspective of data mining.</p>
<p>A comprehensive definition of data science, then, would complement
Donoho’s with an authentic representation of the contribution of
computational technologies and practices to the field. It would
encompass data analysis and data mining and would embrace the epistemic
tensions that exist between these ancestral fields, such as those
between mathematical statistics and computational thinking, and between
mathematical models and those that emerge from data.</p>

<h2>A Common Trope: The Image of the Pipeline<a class="headerlink" href="#a-common-trope-the-image-of-the-pipeline" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>A review of the literature, from sources attempting to define data
science, and the antecedent fields of data analysis and data mining,
reveals that most most definitions invoke the image of a data
pipeline—a sequence of events through which data flows as it moves
from primary source material to finished analytical product. The image
is so pervasive and longstanding as to suggest that it functions as a
root metaphor that undergirds our understanding of data science at a
deep, cognitive level. The image of the pipeline describes the flow of
data from a variety of sources—as found in databases or produced by
intentional experiments or generated by sensors—through a series of
stages ending in the communication of analytical results or the
development of a data product. These stages include cleaning, exploring,
and modeling the data.</p>
<p>The idea that this pipeline is fundamental to data science is not
new—in the 1990s, data mining was conceptualized as a pipeline with
the SEMMA and CRISP-DM models that are widely adopted by data scientists
today in one form or another, such as Mason and Wiggins’ OSEMI model
(Azevedo and Santos 2008; Mason and Wiggins 2010). In fact, the image
goes back at least to the early 1960s, when the Data Sciences Laboratory
of the U.S. Air Force was created to address the fact that “[m]odern
data processing and computing machinery, together with improved
communications, has made it possible to <em>ask for</em>, <em>collect, process and
use</em> astronomical amounts of detailed data” (AFCRL 1963: 187; emphasis
added). More recently, Donoho’s “50 Years of Data Science” proposes a
framework for the field based on a sequence of six divisions that follow
the structure of a pipeline (Donoho 2017).</p>
<section id="a-common-sequence">
<h3>A Common Sequence<a class="headerlink" href="#a-common-sequence" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>An analysis of a representative sample of definitional essays shows that
the various pipeline stories consist of elements drawn from a standard
sequence of about twelve elements, give or take a few, depending on how
one might expand or contract terms. These may signified by a core set of
verbs or event types (which narratologists call functions), with the
understanding that many synonyms are employed in the examples: (1)
understand, (2) plan, (3) collect, (4) store, (5) clean, (6) explore,
(7) prepare, (8) model, (9), interpret, (10) communicate, (11) deploy,
and (12) reflect. No one definition includes them all, but some are more
comprehensive than others, and different disciplines emphasize different
parts. For example, Hayashi’s statistically-oriented definition of data
science includes just three phases—design {1}, collect {3}, and
analyze {8, 9}—with an emphasis on the experimental design phase in
which data are actually produced through thoughtfully designed
experiments (Hayashi 1998). Mason and Wiggins propose five—obtain {3,
4}, scrub {5}, explore {6}, model {8}, and interpret {9}—which
highlights two conditions that define industrial data science, the
simultaneous availability of data (one merely obtains it, say through
web scraping) and their poor condition relative to analysis, i.e. the
need to scrub and wrangle them into usable form (Mason and Wiggins
2010). The CRISP-DM model is the most comprehensive, with seven phases
defined (if we include the unnamed but visually depicted function of
storage), emphasizing the importance of understanding both the business
proposition and data before anything is done with it (Wirth and Hipp
1999). In addition, it modifies the metaphor of the pipeline,
representing it as a circular and iterative process. But, unlike
Donoho’s similarly comprehensive sequence (implied by the ordering of
his six divisions of “greater data science”), it does not include a
“meta” phase devoted to reflecting on the process as a whole (Donoho
2017).</p>
<p>This twelve-part composite pipeline can be simplified by combining
functions that naturally go together, by virtue of the expertise
required to carry them out. This reduction yields about seven phases:
(A) understand and plan, (B) collect and store, (C) clean, prepare, and
explore, (D) model and interpret, (E) communicate, (F) deploy, and (G)
reflect. Each of these may be considered a “chapter” in the story. Note
that the number of verbs in each chapter title does not necessarily
predict the length of its content. For example, the chapter on “model
and interpret” covers a wide range of activities from a variety of
perspectives, including classical statistics, machine learning, and
computational simulation. It’s a big and complicated chapter, but it is
just one chapter among seven, even though many may consider it to be the
most important chapter.</p>

<section id="an-arc-with-four-zones">
<h3>An Arc with Four Zones<a class="headerlink" href="#an-arc-with-four-zones" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p><img alt="" src="content/media/image1.png" />{width=”3.83in” height=”1.7in”}To be sure, the
middle chapter plays a central role in our story. If we think of the
story as following a classical “there and back again” structure—a
chiasmus pattern like X~1~ Y~1~ Z Y~2~ X~2~—then chapter D is the
pivot, while chapters A, B, and C mirror E, F, and G. Thinking of the
story in this way allows us to identify a parallel structure in the
pipeline, connecting phases that are usually seen as separate.
Specifically, we may visualize the pipeline as an arc, in which chapters
in the first half of the pipeline mirror the those of the second half.
We may then group chapters by the pairs formed in this way, yielding
four zones—A and G belong to zone I, B and F to II, C and E to III,
and D to IV—as in the following diagram ():</p>
<p><img alt="" src="content/media/image2.png" />{width=”4.32in” height=”1.68in”}With this
visualization, we can discern some interesting properties about the data
science pipeline that are not obvious in the original sequential image.
For one, the arc structure suggests that the two ends of the pipe are
not separate; both make direct contact with the external world. The
external world—natural or social–from which data are pulled is the
same world into which data products are inserted. This insight echoes
the CRISP-DM model, which connects A and G (actually F), except that the
two ends of the arc model are not directly connected. Instead, they come
into contact with—and are separated by—the world in all of its
complexity and unpredictability. The relationship between the effects
caused by our data products G and the data we pull from the world A is
not given but a matter of discovery—and often surprise.</p>
<p>At this point, we can explore the unifying themes associated with the
four zones in our arc model by transposing the preceding visualization,
which draws attention to what is common to each pairing (see ). This
generates four candidate areas of data science expertise—activities
that, although they appear on opposite ends of the pipeline,
nevertheless share basic knowledge, know-how, and areas of concern. Zone
IV is the easiest to interpret in this way because as the pivot of the
arc it is not paired. It represents the work of modeling a problem
mathematically, as well as evaluating and interpreting the results of
mathematical modeling. This work requires data to be available in a
particular form—clean and organized, usually as “tidy” analytical
tables. Zone I is also relatively easy to interpret: the functions in
this group each involve understanding the relationship between the
pipeline and the external world, the messy interface between the
enterprise of data science and the variety of real world situations in
which it operates. We may note in passing that I and IV can be
contrasted in several ways—messy vs clean, exoteric vs esoteric,
qualitative vs quantitative, existential vs essential, concrete vs
abstract, etc.</p>
<p>When it comes to zones II and III, the interpretation of results is less
straightforward. This is because the reality of the kind of work
performed in these areas is not as clear-cut as it is for I and IV. Both
II and III exhibit an internal complexity not found in the others, and
the two are less clearly separable from each other than they are from
the other two. One reason for this complexity is that here pure and
applied forms of knowledge intermingle in ways that defy easy
description from an academic perspective. For example, the work of “data
wrangling,” considered distinctive to data science, spans the two
domains and involves a complex mixture of specific technological
know-how and general scientific principles. It turns out that the
relationship between these kinds of knowledge is highly contested, as
evidenced by the reception of Donoho’s “50 Years of Data Science,” which
has been criticized for separating science from engineering and demoting
the importance of the latter (Donoho 2017). Regardless of the validity
of this criticism, there is without doubt a long-standing conflict
between data mining and data analysis over what counts as valid forms of
knowledge, and this conflict emerges in the representation of zones II
and III we find in our corpus.</p>
<p>We can take the conflict of interpretations over the status of technical
knowledge in data science as a clue and use it to identify two broad
dimensions that cross-cut the functions in zones II and III: technical
know-how and abstract representation. Technical know-how (II´) involves
expertise in developing and deploying software and hardware designed to
handle data at scale, including high-performance computing, big data
architectures (such as Hadoop and its descendants), and data-oriented
programming languages and libraries. These areas are highly specific and
change rapidly relative to other forms of knowledge, and so are often
omitted from, or under-represented in, academic curricula, even though
to many they are the <em>sine qua non</em> of data science. Abstract
representation (III´), on the other hand, involves expertise in areas
ranging from how data are to be modeled for capture and analysis to how
the results of analyses are to be presented to non-expert
decision-makers. These areas of knowledge strive for formal generality
over the long run; they are often expressed as grammars or design
languages, frequently with visual modes (such as entity-relationship
models and unified modeling language UML). They also include other forms
of visualization, such as the plots developed for exploratory data
analysis, such as box plots, and those used to represent statistical
facts and analytical results in dashboards and infographics.</p>

<section id="the-four-areas-plus-one">
<h3>The Four Areas, Plus One<a class="headerlink" href="#the-four-areas-plus-one" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>We are now ready to define and name the areas of data science expertise
that emerge from an analysis of the pipeline considered as an arc. In
each case, we want to identify the common context shared by the paired
activities in each zone as well as the tension that exists between them
by virtue of their occupying opposite sides of the pipeline. In many
cases, although we can identify a shared theme in each zone’s work, the
reality is that practitioners do not always interact or share
disciplinary homes. One of the benefits of this model will be to
identify these points of synergy and to identify new disciplinary
boundaries.</p>
<section id="area-i-value">
<h4>Area I: Value<a class="headerlink" href="#area-i-value" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The area of value is defined by the relationship of data science to the
world from which it draws data and into which it inserts data products.
More broadly, it concerns the relationship of data science to its
motivational horizon—for whom and what do we practice data science and
why? It combines the traditional discipline of ethics with the
professional activities of business planning, policy making, developing
motivations for scientific research, and other activities that have a
direct impact on people and the planet. This is the area where we
determine what we do versus what we do not do, in order to maximize
societal and environmental benefit and minimize harm. It is also the
area that looks inward to the other data science areas and provides
guidance on such issues as algorithmic bias or open science. Common
activities include the forming of value propositions that initiate data
science projects, research into how data is created and used “in the
wild,” understanding the ethics of data acquisition, manipulation,
communication, and sharing, and the application of data products in the
world.</p>
</section>
<section id="area-ii-design">
<h4>Area II´: Design<a class="headerlink" href="#area-ii-design" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The area of design is defined by the relationship between human and
machine forms of representation. This relationship is bidirectional:
human-generated data flowing into the pipeline must be represented for
machine consumption (H2M), while analytically transformed data going out
must be represented for human consumption (M2H). This area therefore
includes expertise in human-machine interaction as it appears at the
points of both consuming data and producing data products. Activities
here include the representation and communication of captured data for
the work of analytics, e.g. in database modeling, the curation of data,
and of complex data and analytical results to humans to drive
decision-making and influence behavior. It also includes the making of
things, with purpose (i.e. to solve problems) and intent (meaning,
concision, focus). A key part of the area is the broad practice of what
is often called visualization, the translation of complex quantitative
information into visual (and other sensory) forms that non-experts can
understand. In slightly more technical terms, the area of design focuses
on what Zuboff called “informating,” the process by which the world is
represented for computation and analytics, and also by which analytical
models and results are represented to the world (Zuboff 1995). These two
processes often produce competing representations—a private one <em>of</em>
the world for the data scientist, and a public one <em>for</em> the world of
the results of analytics. One task of this area is to reconcile these
two representations.</p>
</section>
<section id="area-iii-systems">
<h4>Area III´: Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#area-iii-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The area of systems is defined by the technological infrastructure that
is common to the pipeline but concentrated in the activities of
wrangling data, deploying data products, and building out systems to
support these activities at scale. This area includes expertise in
infrastructure systems and architectures to support working with big
data—big in terms of volume, velocity, and variety—and building high
performance systems in both development and production environments. It
includes the broad areas of hardware and software as such—computer
technology as opposed to computer science. Key activities include
developing cloud resources, building performant pipelines to ingest and
aggregate data, developing networks of resilient distributed data, and
writing and using software to accomplish tasks. This area is often
referred to as “data engineering” or “machine learning engineering,”
which, according to Owen, “is most of what Data Science is and
Statistics is not” (Owen 2015).</p>
</section>
<section id="area-iv-analytics">
<h4>Area IV: Analytics<a class="headerlink" href="#area-iv-analytics" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The area of analytics is defined by the practice of mathematical
modeling based on data. This area includes what many consider to be the
essence of data science, the combination of statistical methods with
machine learning, along with information theory, optimization, signal
processing, network analysis, complexity theory, and other rigorous
quantitative methods from a variety of fields. Although unified by a
broad commitment to advanced mathematical models and computational
algorithms, in reality this is a heterogeneous collection of competing
schools and methods. Tensions include inference vs prediction,
parametric vs non-parametric (kernel-based) methods, frequentist vs
Bayesian statistics, analytic vs algorithmic solutions (including
simulations), etc. Key activities include clustering, pattern
recognition, regression, rule mining, feature engineering, model
selection, performance evaluation, and a host of other activities.
Although currently dominated by statistical methods, this area also
includes the rule-based methods that dominated the field of artificial
intelligence before the more recent successes of statistical learning
and deep learning.</p>
</section>
<section id="area-v-practice">
<h4>Area V: Practice<a class="headerlink" href="#area-v-practice" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The preceding four areas each represent areas of foundational knowledge,
forms of expertise that can be taught as more or less separate subjects.
In practice, however, these areas represent the interlocking parts of a
division of labor that are integrated in the pipeline. This area
consists of actual activities that brings people together to combine
expertise from each of the four areas. It is characterized by data
science teams working together and with external parties to develop
solutions and projects that are responsible, authentic, efficient, and
effective. Practice is also where the core areas of data science come
into contact with a broad spectrum of domain knowledge and real world
problems. The following diagram () shows the central, integrative role
played by practice:</p>

<h3><img alt="" src="content/media/image3.png" />{width=”4.72in” height=”1.92in”}Two Principal Components<a class="headerlink" href="#width-4-72in-height-1-92in-two-principal-components" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h3>
<p>Is there a way to understand how the four primary areas are related to
each other, beyond their being composed of functions from the same
pipeline? Put another way, does the pipeline-as-arc model exhibit any
structural features that will help us conceptualize the broader space of
data science? Two such features stand out: (1) the opposition between
concrete and abstract forms of representation, and (2) between human and
machine processing.</p>
<p>Regarding the concrete and the abstract, it’s clear that the arc model
has a metric quality to it: as one moves toward the pivot point of
analysis, one moves away from the concrete messiness of reality as
experienced to the “tidy” and abstract world of mathematics; similarly,
as one moves from the pivot back to the world, there is a requirement to
convert esoteric results into more humanly intelligible forms, often
through a process of concretization; visualizations succeed by employing
concrete metaphors that flesh out mathematical ideas that are
notoriously detached from the imagination—no one can imagine, for
example, n-dimensional spaces beyond a handful of dimensions. The arc
describes a dialectic of abstraction and concretization that defines the
ebb and flow and data science work.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="content/media/image4.png" />{width=”3.67in” height=”1.71in”}The dimension of
human and machine processing exhibits a similar duality, that between
the conversion of information from humanly accessible forms, such as
given by data acquired by instruments, into machine readable and
processible forms, and the reverse. The process of moving from human to
machine representations is a large part of what data capture, modeling,
and wrangling is all about, while the process of converting the results
of machine learning, broadly conceived, into humanly actionable form is
what visualization and productization are all about. The reality of this
dualism is captured by the concept of human-computer interaction (HCI),
an established field that is applicable to both sides of the arc.</p>
<p>How do the four fundamental areas map onto these two dimensions? We can
define each area as a combination of one pole from each duality; the
four areas result from all possible permutations of the two dimensions.
This produces the following high level characterizations of each area:
(1) Value is concerned with concrete humanity, (2) Design with abstract
humanity, (3) Analytics with abstract machinery, and (4) Systems is
concerned with concrete machinery. All of these make intuitive sense,
with the exception of Design. This is consistent, however, with the fact
that the area of Design emerges from this analysis as an undervalued and
not well understood area of expertise, even though Yau emphasized it
early on (Yau 2009b). Indeed, one of the consequences of this analysis
is to train our attention on this area of knowledge and to develop it
further.</p>
<p>In any case, it is worth noting that the four combinations are
surprisingly analogous to the four approaches to artificial intelligence
defined by Russel and Norvig, which is based on the space opened by
combining thinking/acting with human/rational: (1) thinking humanly, (2)
thinking rationally, (3) acting humanly, and (4) acting rationally
(Russell and Norvig 1995: 5). Moreover, it is easy to see how the
following analogies make sense: abstract : concrete :: thinking :
action, and human : rational :: human : machine. In fact, it appears
that the same space is shared by data science as defined here and
artificial intelligence, with the difference that the former model is
focused on forms of labor carried out by the data scientist, whereas the
latter concerns forms of intelligence built by AI specialists. The two
areas are obviously adjacent.</p>
<p>One exciting interpretation of the two dimensions defined here is that
they correspond to two principal components that undergird the general
field of data science. As components, these axes define two orthogonal
dimensions within which all the specific topics of data science may, in
principle, be plotted. The reality behind these axes may be that they
represent cognitive styles associated with the division of labor implied
by the data science pipeline.</p>
<section id="pc1-human-versus-machine">
<h4>PC1: Human versus Machine<a class="headerlink" href="#pc1-human-versus-machine" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The human-machine axis accounts for the most variance in the field. This
seems evident from the fact that Conway’s Venn diagram model of data
science represents only the machine side of our model (with practice
replaced by “substantive expertise”). The human side—Value and
Design—is left out, or short-changed by being lumped in with domain
knowledge. The very fact that the human side has to be explained and
added to the model suggests strongly that it defines a pole at some
distance from the areas of knowledge described in Conway’s model. The
human pole refers to humanity understood as situated in their
historical, social, and cultural milieu. It is synonymous with <em>human
experience</em>. The machine pole refers to the technoscientific apparatus
of formal, quantitative reasoning that operates on representations of
the human and the world. In the context of data science, it is more or
less synonymous with <em>machine intelligence</em>, broadly conceived to
include machine learning but also other modes of analysis on the
spectrum of prediction and inference. Given these poles, the
human-machine axis represents the opposition between humanistic
disciplines that seek to understand human experience as such, and the
formal sciences that employ machine intelligence, broadly conceived, to
interpret that experience as represented and aggregated in the form of
data.</p>
</section>
<section id="pc2-concrete-versus-abstract">
<h4>PC2: Concrete versus Abstract<a class="headerlink" href="#pc2-concrete-versus-abstract" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h4>
<p>The abstract-concrete axis accounts for the difference between two forms
of knowledge, roughly between direct experience and the indirect
representation of that experience enabled through data. Both the realm
of Value and Systems involve immersion in the messy details of lived
experience—and direct acquaintance with the devils in those details.
This is the messy world of hacks and ironies. The realms of Design and
Analysis, on the other hand, are founded on abstract representations
that strive for clear and distinct purity, and which allow for deductive
reasoning to succeed at the cost of simplifying assumptions and reduced
representations. This is the orderly world of models. The concrete pole
refers to situated knowledge, knowledge as understood by hackers and
makers, but also ethnographers who seek to maximize thick description in
their work. It represents <em>concrete materiality</em>. The abstract pole
refers to formal knowledge, knowledge in the form of mathematical
symbolism, deductive proofs, and algorithmic patterns. It is <em>abstract
form</em>. Given these poles, the concrete-abstract axis is roughly the
opposition between applied and pure forms of knowledge, between those
that embrace materiality and those that seek purity of form.</p>

complementary forms of knowledge. The vertical axis defines the dominant
polarity between analysis—the <em>how</em> of data science, often identified
entirely with it, contrasted with the <em>why</em> of data science, from which
data science derives its meaning and value as a profession. The
horizontal access defines the polarity of methods that are often
obscured in academic definitions of data science—the supporting
practices that make the Analytics component work in the first place.</p>

<section id="interpreting-the-model">
<h2>Interpreting the Model<a class="headerlink" href="#interpreting-the-model" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h2>
<p>The point of the 4 + 1 model, abstract as it is, is to provide a
practical template for strategically planning the various elements of a
school of data science. To serve as an effective template, a model must
be general. But generality if often purchased at the cost of intuitive
understanding. The following caveats may help make sense of the model
when considering its usefulness when applied to various concrete
activities.</p>
<p><strong>The model describes areas of academic expertise, not objective
reality</strong>. It is a map of a division of labor writ large. Although each
of the areas has clear connections to the others, the question to ask
when deciding where an activity belongs is: <em>who would be an expert at
doing it</em>? The realms help refine this question: the analytics area, for
example, contains people who are good at working with abstract
machinery. The four areas have the virtue of isolating intuitively
correct communities of expertise. For example, people who are great at
data product design may not know the esoteric depths of machine
learning, and that adepts at machine learning are not usually experts in
understanding human society and normative culture.</p>
<p><strong>Each area in the model contains a collection of subfields that need to
be teased out</strong>. Some areas will have more subfields than others.
Although some areas may be smaller than others in terms of number of
experts (faculty) and courses, each area has a major impact on the
overall practice of data science and the quality of an academic
program’s activities. In addition, these subfields are in an important
sense “more real” than the categories. We can imagine them forming a
dense network in which the areas define communities with centroids, and
which are more interconnected than the clean-cut image of the model
implies.</p>
<p><strong>The principal components abstract/concrete and human/machine are meant
to help imagine the kinds of activities that belong in each area</strong>,
through their connotations when combined to form the four
bigrams—concrete human, abstract human, concrete machine, and abstract
machine. For example, the area of value as the realm of the “concrete
human” (or perhaps “concrete humanity”) is meant to connote what the
Spanish philosopher Unamuno called the world of “flesh and bone” within
which we live and die, that is, where things matter. On the other hand,
analytics as the realm of the “abstract machine” is meant to connote the
platonic world of mathematical reasoning which, since Euclid, has been
characterized by rigorous, abstract, deductive reasoning that has
literally been described as an abstract machine (see Alan Turing).</p>
<p><strong>At the center of this model and each area is people</strong>. Even in the
area classified as “abstract machine,” people and human thinking is at
the center.</p>

<dd><p>The expression “big data” was also launched into the public sphere
in 2008 when <em>Nature</em> devoted a special issue to the topic of “Big
Data: Science in the Petabyte Era” on the 10^th^ anniversary of
Google’s incorporation (<em>Nature</em> 2008). The articles in the issue
explore the premise that science might learn from Google’s model of
knowledge production, a view famously championed by Chris Anderson
in “The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method
Obsolete,” which appeared in an issue of <em>WIRED</em> also devoted to the
“petabyte age” (Anderson 2008).</p>

<dd><p>This is by no means a full accounting of the usage of the term,
which can be traced back the 1960s. This history is the subject of
another essay.</p>

<dd><p>Attempts to define either computer science of statistics as “data
science” go back much father.</p>
