# The History of Data Science

## What is data science? 

The field of data science is characterized by a paradox. Although there are many jobs titles and academic programs that identify with the name, there is surprisingly little consensus on a definition. 

associated with the field over the past decade suggest that it has matured into an established body of knowledge. Yet consensus on the definition of data science remains low. Members and observers of the field possess widely variant understandings of it, resulting in divergent expectations of the knowledge, skill sets, and abilities required by data scientists. Definitions—when they are not laundry lists—range from a rebranded version of statistics to data-driven science to the science of data to simply the application of machine learning to so-called big data to solve real world problems. These differences cannot be reduced to so-called semantics; they reflect a range of deep-seated institutional commitments and values, as well as variant understandings about the nature of knowledge and science. The lack of shared understanding poses a significant problem for academic programs in data science: it inhibits the development of standards and a professional commuity, confounds the allocation of resources, confuses labor markets, and threatens to undermine the authority and long-term prospects of these programs.
